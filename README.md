### Professional Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my professional website! Here you can find information about my work experience, the tools I use, the software projects I've developed, and the tech topics I'm interested in.

### About Me

I‚Äôm a software developer with more than 4.5 years of experience in artificial intelligence. I‚Äôve worked on many different projects, using both full-stack development and AI technologies to build useful solutions.

### Expertise

#### Full-Stack Development in AI Projects

üß© I‚Äôve worked as a full-stack developer on both desktop and web applications, contributing to AI-focused projects. My role involved building scalable front-end interfaces and robust back-end systems that support intelligent data workflows.

#### Computer Vision for Marine Environments

üåä I‚Äôve developed computer vision solutions for complex scenarios such as multi-object detection in marine environments. These projects required deep learning techniques and real-time image processing to identify and track objects under challenging conditions.

#### Anomaly Detection in Big Data

üìä In recent months, I‚Äôve focused on building anomaly detection models for large-scale datasets. My work centers on LSTM-based architectures that uncover hidden patterns and irregularities, helping systems respond proactively to unexpected behaviors.
